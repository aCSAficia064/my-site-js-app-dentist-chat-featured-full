Open Account, Get Free Stock

How does it work?
We’ll add 1 share of free stock to your account when you link your bank account and fulfill the conditions in your promotion. You’ll be able to keep the stock or sell it after 2 trading days.

NOTE
Make sure to link your bank account in order to earn your free stock. For more information about linking your bank account, click here.

How does Robinhood choose which stock I get?
The shares of free stock are chosen randomly from our inventory of settled shares. Because the shares are chosen randomly, you may not receive the same stock as others.

The value of the share at the time of purchase may be anywhere between $3 and $225, and fluctuates based on market movements. We choose companies based on the price of each share, from the most popular and highest total value (market capitalization) companies on Robinhood. Keep in mind there is an approximately 98% chance of the stock bonus having a value of $2.50-$10.00.

Can I open a second Robinhood account to get a free stock?
No, each person is only allowed one Robinhood brokerage account.
